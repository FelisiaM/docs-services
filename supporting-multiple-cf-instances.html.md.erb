<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

It is possible to register a service broker with multiple Cloud Foundry instances. It may be necessary for the broker to know which Cloud Foundry instance is making a given request. For example, when using [Dashboard Single Sign-On](dashboard-sso.html), the broker is expected to interact with the authorization and token endpoints for a given Cloud Foundry instance.

There are two strategies that can be used to discover which Cloud Foundry instance is making a given request.

## Routing & Authentication
The broker can use unique credentials and/or a unique url for each Cloud Foundry instance. When registering the broker, different Cloud Foundry instances can be configured to use different base urls that include a unique id. For example:

* On Cloud Foundry instance 1, the service broker is registered with the url `broker.example.com/123`
* On Cloud Foundry instance 2, the service broker is registered with the url `broker.example.com/456`

## X-Api-Info-Location Header

All calls to the broker from Cloud Foundry include an `X-Api-Info-Location` header containing the `/v2/info` url for that instance. The `/v2/info` endpoint will return further information, including the location of that Cloud Foundry instance's UAA.

Support for this header was introduced in cf-release v212.
